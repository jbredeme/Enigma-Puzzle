# Enigma Puzzle Game

Enigma puzzle game application animates a random sequential tile pattern across a grid of tiles. The animation shows no more than four titles at any given time (i.e. like a slithering snake). Once the pattern animation has been completed, it is now the player's turn to reproduce the pattern by touching the titles (order does not matter) on the device. To make it interesting a player is given only three attempts to repeat a single pattern. A failed attempt is the result of selection an invalid tile. A player must complete three patterns to complete a level.

## Usage
