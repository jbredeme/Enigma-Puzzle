# Anagram Game

This is a simple Android Anagram game application that pulls words from an anagram dictionary database allows the user to perform a word play by rearranging the letters of a word to produce a new word using all the original letters exactly once. The number of words retrieved from the database is presented to the user as the denominator in a fractional notation underneath the number of correct words found (numerator).

## Usage
```c
Enter in a word formed by rearranging the letters of another.
```
